# GORE-Conversion-Tool

The GCT is a tool created to perform the transformation between Goal Models with the help of the GORO Ontology. This tool was developed in the context of the research on Goal Modeling Languages conducted within the [ROSE Project](https://nemo.inf.ufes.br/projects/rose/).

Currently the tool performs conversion of the following languages:
- iStar for KAOS: conversion of models created in the [piStar](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~jhcp/pistar/tool/#) tool to models that can be read in the [Objectiver](http://www.objectiver.com/index.php?id=3) tool.

GCT generates intermediate models, which are GORO instantiations in OWL files that can be loaded into applications such as [Protègè](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
